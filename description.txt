Have you ever experienced déjà vu so strong it felt like a system reboot? What if it was?  Welcome to the terrifying truth: our reality is a deeply flawed simulation, and the glitches are getting worse. People are disappearing.

This isn't just a theory anymore. We're diving deep into the logged error reports from the "Glitchnessers"—people who have witnessed the fatal errors in our world's code. We'll explore the bone-chilling evidence that our reality is starting to crash.

In this video, we expose the glitches the system doesn't want you to see:
- The Clipping Error: Hear the story of a phone that falls *through* a solid floor, its ringtone now a faint, muffled cry from beneath the floorboards. 
- The NPC Loop: Witness the terrifying account of a person stalked by a stranger stuck in a repetitive animation, their eyes blank and their voice nothing but garbled static. 
- The Texture Failure: Experience the dread of a driver watching the road ahead of them dissolve into a checkerboard of unrendered textures before snapping back into place. 

But the horror escalates. The system is fighting back. When you notice a glitch, it notices you. We'll share harrowing tales of "The Cleaners," strange entities who appear to patch out errors... by deleting the witnesses from existence.  Your memories are rewritten, your existence scrubbed, and the world moves on as if you were never there.

What happens when the simulation can't be patched? What happens when it begins to shut down? Look around you. Does everything feel completely solid? Watch now, before you get deleted.
